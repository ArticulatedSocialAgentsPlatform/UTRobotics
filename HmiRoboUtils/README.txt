python packages to interface ROS with Apache Apollo middleware, to facilitate bridging AsapRealizer to ROS robots.

Also contains utilities to control robots via a midi panel, and a generic control app for controlling the ROS robots exposed via the bridge

NOTE:

Some of the bridge code in this packages has been improved for the EyePi robot; so in the EyePi module you might find a better version of that one... check whether the improvement still needs to be put back here as well
